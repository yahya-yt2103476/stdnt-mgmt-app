It explores essential topics such as data types, control flow (loops and conditionals), functions, data structures (like arrays and objects), and fundamental algorithms. The goal is to equip learners with a language-agnostic mental framework for problem-solving and software development, enabling them to grasp the logic and structure behind writing effective code, regardless of the specific programming language they choose to use.","creditHours":3,"category":"programming","prerequisites":[],"id":8},{"id":7,"shortName":"CMPS208","name":"Artificial Intelligence","description":"This course introduces the basics of artificial intelligence.","creditHours":5,"category":"programming","prerequisites":[]}]

# Thank you for complying witht he following:

1. Don't forget to change the names of all files called index.whatever (give it it's rightful name)
2. None of our CSS pages have rules for different screen sizes don't forget it in your CSS file (No rush for this)
3. you will notice i used a layout which we didn't take in this course display: block but in short 
    Elements with display:block will take up the full available width of their parent container.
    you can then manipluate it further using margins and border etc (there is probably more to it but i used it for that purpose).
   
nth. ... add more notes ...
